To build your site run the `build` command:

```
./staticus build
```

Your static site will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Previewing changes

To preview changes as you build your site run the `watch` command:

```
npm run watch
```

This will use Browsersync to run a development server at `http://localhost:3000` where any changes you make will be reflected in the browser.
