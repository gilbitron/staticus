When it comes to deploying your site, you simply need to [build your site](/docs/build-site) and [compile your assets](/docs/compile-assets). Then everything in the `/dist` folder can be deployed to your hosting provider of choice as a static site.

```text
npm run prod
```

Note: The `prod` NPM script will build your site and compile your assets.
